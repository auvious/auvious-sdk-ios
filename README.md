# AuviousSDK

This is Auvious iOS SDK, which simplifies integration with [Auvious](https://auvious.com) services. It provides both an API which allows you to build your custom call/conference UI, and ready out-of-the-shelf UI components/views which simplify integration for the most common scenarios.

## Requirements

iOS version >= 13.0

## Installation

AuviousSDK is available through as a [CocoaPod](https://cocoapods.org). You can install it using one of the following ways:

- Auvious Cocoa Pods Repo. Add the following sources to your Podfile
  ```ruby
  source 'https://github.com/auvious/CocoaPodSpecs.git'
  ```
  Make sure you also include the official CocoaPods repo source or a valid mirror of it
  ```ruby
  source 'https://cdn.cocoapods.org/'
  ```
  Last but not least, you need to add the AuviousSDK pod on all targets that will need it
  ```ruby
  pod 'AuviousSDK', '1.4.0'
  ```
- Auvious SDK github repo. This method only requires the following line on the target dependencies:
  ```ruby
  pod 'AuviousSDK', :git => 'https://github.com/auvious/auvious-sdk-ios.git', :tag => '1.4.0'
  ```

Next you need to run `pod install` in order for AuviousSDK and it's dependencies to be installed in the project workspace.

Finally you'll need disable bitcode in 'Build Settings' and also add NSMicrophoneUsageDescription,NSCameraUsageDescription texts in Info.plist.

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Info.plist Permissions

Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` to request camera and microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Camera access is required for video calls.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Microphone access is required for audio calls.</string>
```

### 2. Build Settings

Disable Bitcode in your target's **Build Settings**:

- Navigate to **Build Settings → Enable Bitcode** and set it to **No**.

### 3. Background Audio (Optional)

If you want audio to continue when the app goes to the background, add the audio background mode to your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

Then enable it in the SDK configuration (see `backgroundAudioEnabled` below).

### 4. App Lifecycle Hooks

The SDK needs to be notified when the app moves between foreground and background. Add the following calls in your `AppDelegate` or `SceneDelegate`:

```swift
import AuviousSDK

// In applicationDidEnterBackground / sceneDidEnterBackground
AuviousConferenceSDK.sharedInstance.onApplicationPause()

// In applicationWillEnterForeground / sceneWillEnterForeground
AuviousConferenceSDK.sharedInstance.onApplicationResume()
```

---

## Usage Example

### Simple Conference (Recommended)

The easiest way to add a conference to your app is using the built-in `AuviousConferenceVCNew` view controller.

```swift
import AuviousSDK

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    func joinConference() {
        // 1. Build the configuration
        let config = AuviousConferenceConfiguration()
        config.username = "<ticket>" // set the auvious ticket
        config.baseEndpoint = "https://auvious.video/"
        config.mqttEndpoint = "auvious.video"

        // 2. Set call mode
        config.callMode = .audioVideo

        // 3. (Optional) Customize the UI
        config.conferenceBackgroundColor = .black
        config.cameraAvailable = true
        config.microphoneAvailable = true
        config.speakerAvailable = true
        config.pipAvailable = true
        config.screenSharingAvailable = false
        config.backgroundAudioEnabled = false

        // 4. Present the conference view controller
        let conferenceVC = AuviousConferenceVCNew(configuration: config, delegate: self)
        present(conferenceVC, animated: true)
    }
}

// MARK: - AuviousSimpleConferenceDelegate

extension ViewController: AuviousSimpleConferenceDelegate {

    func onConferenceSuccess() {
        // Called when the conference ends normally
        print("Conference ended successfully")
    }

    func onConferenceError(_ error: AuviousSDKGenericError) {
        // Called on error (authentication failure, network issues, etc.)
        switch error {
        case .AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE:
            print("Authentication failed — check credentials")
        case .NETWORK_ERROR:
            print("Network error")
        case .PERMISSION_REQUIRED:
            print("Camera or microphone permission denied")
        case .INVALID_TICKET(let ticketId):
            print("Invalid ticket: \(ticketId)")
        default:
            print("Conference error: \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```

### Low-Level Conference API

For full control over the conference flow and UI, use `AuviousConferenceSDK` directly.

```swift
import AuviousSDK

class ConferenceManager: AuviousSDKConferenceDelegate {

    func setup() {
        AuviousConferenceSDK.sharedInstance.delegate = self

        // Configure the SDK
        AuviousConferenceSDK.sharedInstance.configure(
            params: [:],
            username: "<ticket>",
            password: "<password>",
            name: nil,
            clientId: "<client-id>",
            baseEndpoint: "https://auvious.video/",
            mqttEndpoint: "auvious.video"
        )

        // Log in
        AuviousConferenceSDK.sharedInstance.login(
            onLoginSuccess: { [weak self] endpoint in
                self?.joinConference()
            },
            onLoginFailure: { error in
                print("Login failed: \(error)")
            }
        )
    }

    func joinConference() {
        AuviousConferenceSDK.sharedInstance.joinConference(
            conferenceId: "<conference-name>",
            onSuccess: { [weak self] conference in
                // Start publishing local audio/video
                self?.publishLocalStream()
            },
            onFailure: { error in
                print("Failed to join: \(error)")
            }
        )
    }

    func publishLocalStream() {
        AuviousConferenceSDK.sharedInstance.startPublishLocalStreamFlow(type: .micAndCam)
    }

    func leaveConference() {
        AuviousConferenceSDK.sharedInstance.leaveConference(
            conferenceId: "<conference-name>",
            onSuccess: { },
            onFailure: { _ in }
        )
    }

    // MARK: - AuviousSDKConferenceDelegate

    func auviousSDK(didReceiveLocalVideoTrack localVideoTrack: RTCVideoTrack!) {
        // Render the local video track in your UI
    }

    func auviousSDK(didReceiveRemoteStream stream: RTCMediaStream, streamId: String,
                    endpointId: String, type: StreamType) {
        // Render the incoming remote stream in your UI
    }

    func auviousSDK(didReceiveLocalStream stream: RTCMediaStream, streamId: String,
                    type: StreamType) {
        // Local stream is ready
    }

    func auviousSDK(onError error: AuviousSDKError) {
        print("SDK error: \(error)")
    }

    func auviousSDK(didChangeState newState: StreamEventState, streamId: String,
                    streamType: StreamType, endpointId: String) {
        // React to stream state transitions (connecting, connected, disconnected, etc.)
    }

    func auviousSDK(trackMuted type: StreamType, endpointId: String) { }
    func auviousSDK(trackUnmuted type: StreamType, endpointId: String) { }
    func auviousSDK(conferenceOnHold flag: Bool) { }
    func auviousSDK(didReceiveConferenceEvent event: ConferenceEvent) { }
    func auviousSDK(didRejoinConference conference: ConferenceSimpleView) { }
    func auviousSDK(recorderStateChanged toActive: Bool) { }
    func auviousSDK(agentPortraitMode flag: Bool, endpointId: String) { }
    func auviousSDK(screenSharingStarted: Bool) { }
    func auviousSDK(screenSharingStopped: Bool) { }
    func auviousSDK(didResumeFromBackground withActiveAudio: Bool) { }
}
```

## Examples

The following example applications are included in this repository. If unsure, begin with ExampleSimpleConference, which demonstrates how to use a ready-to-use ViewController we provide, for joining a video conference call.

- [ExampleCall](Example/ExampleCall)
- [ExampleSimpleCall](Example/ExampleSimpleCall)
- [ExampleConference](Example/ExampleConference)
- [ExampleSimpleConference](Example/ExampleSimpleConference)

To try the above examples you should open the Example/AuviousSDK.xcworkspace in Xcode.

There is also a separate repository with examples available at https://github.com/auvious/ios-examples. At the current moment the following examples are available there:

- [SimpleConference](https://github.com/auvious/ios-examples/tree/master/SimpleConference) Similar to ExampleSimpleConference written in SwiftUI.
- [GenesysCloudSimpleConference](https://github.com/auvious/ios-examples/tree/master/GenesysCloudSimpleConference) Demonstrates how to quickly add video call capability to your iOS application, utilizing Genesys Cloud webChat channel for ACD routing.

## Publish version

Follow the steps below to publish a new version

### Publish to git

Increase the version in `AuviousSDK.podspec`

Tag git with the version (ex `1.2.0`)

Push the version and the tag to github

### Publish Pod

If this is the first time you do this process in your machine, you need to have cocoapods installed. Follow the instructions in http://cocoapods.org on how to install it in your machine.

Once you have the pod command ready, add the auvious podspec repo to your pod repos by running this command. This will add a repo that requires SSH authentication so be sure that you have setup an SSH key with gitHub.

```
pod repo add <your-pod-name> git@github.com:auvious/CocoaPodSpecs.git
```

Example:

```
pod repo add auvious-cocoa-pod git@github.com:auvious/CocoaPodSpecs.git
```

Next you need to push to that repo

```
pod repo push <your-pod-name> AuviousSDK.podspec --verbose --allow-warnings
```

Example:

```
pod repo push auvious-cocoa-pod AuviousSDK.podspec --verbose --allow-warnings
```
