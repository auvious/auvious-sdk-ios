# AuviousSDK

This is Auvious iOS SDK, which simplifies integration with [Auvious](https://auvious.com) services. It provides both an API which allows you to build your custom call/conference UI, and ready out-of-the-self UI components/views which simplify integration for the most common scenarios.

## Requirements

iOS version >= 13.0

## Installation

AuviousSDK is available through as a [CocoaPod](https://cocoapods.org). You can install it using one of the following ways:

- Auvious Cocoa Pods Repo. Add the following sources to your Podfile
  ```ruby
  source 'https://github.com/auvious/CocoaPodSpecs.git'
  ```
  Make sure you also include the official CocoaPods repo source or a valid mirror of it
  ```ruby
  source 'https://cdn.cocoapods.org/'
  ```
  Last but not least, you need to add the AuviousSDK pod on all targets that will need it
  ```ruby
  pod 'AuviousSDK', '1.2.0'
  ```
- Auvious SDK github repo. This method only requires the following line on the target dependencies:
  ```ruby
  pod 'AuviousSDK', :git => 'https://github.com/auvious/auvious-sdk-ios.git', :tag => '1.2.0'
  ```
  
Next you need to run `pod install` in order for AuviousSDK and it's dependencies to be installed in the project workspace.

Finally you'll need disable bitcode in 'Build Settings' and also add NSMicrophoneUsageDescription,NSCameraUsageDescription texts in Info.plist.

## Examples
The following example applications are included in this repository. If unsure, begin with ExampleSimpleConference, which demonstrates how to use a ready-to-use ViewController we provide, for joining a video conference call.

- [ExampleCall](Example/ExampleCall)
- [ExampleSimpleCall](Example/ExampleSimpleCall)
- [ExampleConference](Example/ExampleConference)
- [ExampleSimpleConference](Example/ExampleSimpleConference)

To try the above examples you should open the Example/AuviousSDK.xcworkspace in Xcode.

There is also a separate repository with examples available at https://github.com/auvious/ios-examples. At the current moment the following examples are available there:

- [SimpleConference](https://github.com/auvious/ios-examples/tree/master/SimpleConference) Similar to ExampleSimpleConference written in SwiftUI.
- [GenesysCloudSimpleConference](https://github.com/auvious/ios-examples/tree/master/GenesysCloudSimpleConference) Demonstrates how to quickly add video call capability to your iOS application, utilizing Genesys Cloud webChat channel for ACD routing.


## Publish version

Follow the steps below to publish a new version

### Publish to git
Increase the version in `AuviousSDK.podspec`

Tag git with the version (ex `1.2.0`)

Push the version and the tag to github

### Publish Pod
If this is the first time you do this process in your machine, you need to have cocoapods installed. Follow the instructions in http://cocoapods.org on how to install it in your machine. 

Once you have the pod command ready, add the auvious podspec repo to your pod repos by running this command 

```
pod repo add <your-pod-name> https://github.com/auvious/CocoaPodSpecs.git
```

Example: 

```
pod repo add auvious-cocoa-pod https://github.com/auvious/CocoaPodSpecs.git
```

Next you need to push to that repo

```
pod repo push <your-pod-name> AuviousSDK.podspec --verbose --allow-warnings
```

Example: 
```
pod repo push auvious-cocoa-pod AuviousSDK.podspec --verbose --allow-warnings
```
